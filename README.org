#+TITLE: Perplex Relational Engine

* Implementation list

- [ ] Correlate logs with a message ID in the context for the kind of operation that raised it
- [ ] On flush, before filling with blanks, sync old info with new info on the page
- [ ] Allocate blob sector to store large data (images, JSON files, etc), keeping only a reference of it when the row is loaded on memory
- [ ] Pagination is currently yielding 0 indexkeys for positions that do not exist, since I read the whole chunk (use physical count to eliminate empty pages, and mark the pages as empty)
